/**
 * Generates the moves a side may play in a given position.
 *
 * <p>This class exists because of a question no single piece can answer. A
 * piece knows how it moves; it does not know the rule that applies to every
 * piece at once: <strong>you may not leave your own king attacked.</strong>
 * That rule needs the whole board, and it arrives in M5. This week the class
 * is where the generation loop lives, moved out of {@code Game}, so that when
 * the rule arrives it has a home.
 *
 * <p>Notice what this class is not. It holds no state: no board, no side to
 * move, no history. Everything it needs arrives as a parameter, so its methods
 * are {@code static} and it cannot be instantiated. Ask it the same question
 * about the same board twice and you get the same answer.
 *
 * <p>Nothing outside the {@code engine} package needs this class. The view and
 * {@code Main} talk to {@link Game}, which decides what "legal" means. That is
 * why one of the two methods below has no access modifier.
